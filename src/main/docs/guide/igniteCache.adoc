## Micronaut Cache

To take advantage of Micronaut Cache, this can be enabled by including the following dependency:

dependency:ignite-cache[groupId="io.micronaut.ignite"]

The primary bean from the Ignite instance is used for the cache configuration. The cacheName will reference the associated cache instance from ignite.
More information about usage can be found https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-cache/snapshot/api/io/micronaut/cache/annotation/CachePut.html[Micronaut Cache].
